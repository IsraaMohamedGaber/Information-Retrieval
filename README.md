# TF-IDF Calculator

This project implements a simple **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** algorithm to convert text into vector format based on the importance of words in a sentence. It demonstrates how to compute TF, IDF, and the final TF-IDF values using two example sentences.

## ðŸ“š What is TF-IDF?

TF-IDF is a statistical measure used in Natural Language Processing to evaluate how important a word is in a document relative to a collection of documents.

- **TF (Term Frequency)** = (Number of times a word appears in a sentence) / (Total number of words in the sentence)
- **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)** = log(Total number of sentences / Number of sentences containing the word)
- **TF-IDF** = TF Ã— IDF

### Sentences

- **Sentence 1 (Sen1)**: `the cat sat on my face`
- **Sentence 2 (Sen2)**: `the dog sat on my bed`

---

### Step 1: Term Frequency (TF)

| Word  | Sen1 TF | Sen2 TF |
|-------|---------|---------|
| the   | 1/6     | 1/6     |
| cat   | 1/6     | 0       |
| sat   | 1/6     | 1/6     |
| on    | 1/6     | 1/6     |
| my    | 1/6     | 1/6     |
| face  | 1/6     | 0       |
| dog   | 0       | 1/6     |
| bed   | 0       | 1/6     |

---

### Step 2: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)

| Word  | IDF        |
|-------|------------|
| the   | log(2/2) = 0   |
| cat   | log(2/1) = 0.3 |
| sat   | log(2/2) = 0   |
| on    | log(2/2) = 0   |
| my    | log(2/2) = 0   |
| face  | log(2/1) = 0.3 |
| dog   | log(2/1) = 0.3 |
| bed   | log(2/1) = 0.3 |

---

### Step 3: TF Ã— IDF (TF-IDF)

| Word  | Sen1 TF-IDF | Sen2 TF-IDF |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| the   | 0           | 0           |
| cat   | 0.115       | 0           |
| sat   | 0           | 0           |
| on    | 0           | 0           |
| my    | 0           | 0           |
| face  | 0.115       | 0           |
| dog   | 0           | 0.115       |
| bed   | 0           | 0.115       |
